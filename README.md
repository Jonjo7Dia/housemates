At first I wanted to just create a full-stack application that encapsulated all that I learnt so far. At the same time, while living with room-mates I saw that we used a bunch of apps to organize our independent and dependent lives, so I thought why not have all the same features that those apps offer and put them under one roof? and now this full-stack project turned into a product that I am building to serve other people in the same situation. Serving the best of both worlds, this application aims to include the backend technologies of node & express, whille taking advantage of the ui componnets that react offers, and to wrap it all up mongoDB will work as the database
